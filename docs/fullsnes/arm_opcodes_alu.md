```

#### Second Operand (Op2)

This may be a shifted register, or a shifted immediate. See Bit 25 and 11-0.

Unshifted Register: Specify Op2 as "Rm", assembler converts to "Rm,LSL#0".

Shifted Register: Specify as "Rm,SSS#Is" or "Rm,SSS Rs" (SSS=LSL/LSR/ASR/ROR).

Immediate: Specify as 32bit value, for example: "#000NN000h", assembler should automatically convert into "#0NNh,ROR#0ssh" as far as possible (ie. as far as a section of not more than 8bits of the immediate is non-zero).

Zero Shift Amount (Shift Register by Immediate, with Immediate=0)

```text
  LSL#0: No shift performed, ie. directly Op2=Rm, the C flag is NOT affected.
  LSR#0: Interpreted as LSR#32, ie. Op2 becomes zero, C becomes Bit 31 of Rm.
  ASR#0: Interpreted as ASR#32, ie. Op2 and C are filled by Bit 31 of Rm.
  ROR#0: Interpreted as RRX#1 (RCR), like ROR#1, but Op2 Bit 31 set to old C.
```

In source code, LSR#32, ASR#32, and RRX#1 should be specified as such -attempts to specify LSR#0, ASR#0, or ROR#0 will be internally converted to LSL#0 by the assembler.

#### Using R15 (PC)

When using R15 as Destination (Rd), note below CPSR description and Execution time description.

When using R15 as operand (Rm or Rn), the returned value depends on the instruction: PC+12 if I=0,R=1 (shift by register), otherwise PC+8 (shift by immediate).

#### Returned CPSR Flags

If S=1, Rd<>R15, logical operations (AND,EOR,TST,TEQ,ORR,MOV,BIC,MVN):

```text
  V=not affected
  C=carryflag of shift operation (not affected if LSL#0 or Rs=00h)
  Z=zeroflag of result
  N=signflag of result (result bit 31)
```

If S=1, Rd<>R15, arithmetic operations (SUB,RSB,ADD,ADC,SBC,RSC,CMP,CMN):

```text
  V=overflowflag of result
  C=carryflag of result
  Z=zeroflag of result
  N=signflag of result (result bit 31)
```

IF S=1, with unused Rd bits=1111b, {P} opcodes (CMPP/CMNP/TSTP/TEQP):

```text
  R15=result  ;modify PSR bits in R15, ARMv2 and below only.
  In user mode only N,Z,C,V bits of R15 can be changed.
  In other modes additionally I,F,M1,M0 can be changed.
  The PC bits in R15 are left unchanged in all modes.
```

If S=1, Rd=R15; should not be used in user mode:

```text
  CPSR = SPSR_<current mode>
  PC = result
  For example: MOVS PC,R14  ;return from SWI (PC=R14_svc, CPSR=SPSR_svc).
```

If S=0: Flags are not affected (not allowed for CMP,CMN,TEQ,TST).

The instruction "MOV R0,R0" is used as "NOP" opcode in 32bit ARM state.

Execution Time: (1+p)S+rI+pN. Whereas r=1 if I=0 and R=1 (ie. shift by register); otherwise r=0. And p=1 if Rd=R15; otherwise p=0.
