# CPU Memory Addressing

#### Opcode Addressing Modes

```text
  Name           Native   Nocash
  Implied        -        A,X,Y,S,P
  Immediate      #nn      nn
  Zero Page      nn       [nn]
  Zero Page,X    nn,X     [nn+X]
  Zero Page,Y    nn,Y     [nn+Y]
  Absolute       nnnn     [nnnn]
  Absolute,X     nnnn,X   [nnnn+X]
  Absolute,Y     nnnn,Y   [nnnn+Y]
  (Indirect,X)   (nn,X)   [[nn+X]]
  (Indirect),Y   (nn),Y   [[nn]+Y]
```

Zero Page - [nn] [nn+X] [nn+Y]

Uses an 8bit parameter (one byte) to address the first 256 of memory at 0000h..00FFh. This limited range is used even for "nn+X" and "nn+Y", ie.

"C0h+60h" will access 0020h (not 0120h).

Absolute - [nnnn] [nnnn+X] [nnnn+Y]

Uses a 16bit parameter (two bytes) to address the whole 64K of memory at 0000h..FFFFh. Because of the additional parameter bytes, this is a bit slower than Zero Page accesses.

Indirect - [[nn+X]] [[nn]+Y]

Uses an 8bit parameter that points to a 16bit parameter in page zero.

Even though the CPU doesn't support 16bit registers (except for the program counter), this (double-)indirect addressing mode allows to use variable 16bit pointers.

#### On-Chip Bi-directional I/O port

Addresses (00)00h and (00)01h are occupied by an I/O port which is built-in into 6510, 8500, 7501, 8501 CPUs (eg. used in C64 and C16), be sure not to use the addresses as normal memory. For description read chapter about I/O ports.

#### Caution

Because of the identical format, assemblers will be more or less unable to separate between [XXh+r] and [00XXh+r], the assembler will most likely produce [XXh+r] when address is already known to be located in page 0, and [00XXh+r] in case of forward references.

Beside for different opcode size/time, [XXh+r] will always access page 0 memory (even when XXh+r>FFh), while [00XXh+r] may direct to memory in page 0 or 1, to avoid unpredictable results be sure not to use (00)XXh+r>FFh if possible.
