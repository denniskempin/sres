# ARM Opcodes: Memory: Single Data Swap (SWP)

#### Opcode Format

```text
  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition
  27-23  Must be 00010b for this instruction
         Opcode (fixed)
           SWP{cond}{B} Rd,Rm,[Rn]      ;Rd=[Rn], [Rn]=Rm
  22     B - Byte/Word bit (0=swap 32bit/word, 1=swap 8bit/byte)
  21-20  Must be 00b for this instruction
  19-16  Rn - Base register                     (R0-R14)
  15-12  Rd - Destination Register              (R0-R14)
  11-4   Must be 00001001b for this instruction
  3-0    Rm - Source Register                   (R0-R14)
```

SWP/SWPB supported by ARMv2a and up.

Swap works properly including if Rm and Rn specify the same register.

R15 may not be used for either Rn,Rd,Rm. (Rn=R15 would be MRS opcode).

Upper bits of Rd are zero-expanded when using Byte quantity. For info about byte and word data memory addressing, read LDR and STR opcode description.

Execution Time: 1S+2N+1I. That is, 2N data cycles, 1S code cycle, plus 1I.

#### Mis-aligned 32bit SWP (rotated read)

The SWP opcode works like a combination of LDR and STR, that means, it does read-rotated, but does write-unrotated.
